How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

- At first I was just creating projects to creat projects. But at some point you learn that your project should have a meaning or a purpose. YOu then ask yourself what purpose will the app do? What problems will it solve? What is the target audience for this app. Creating user stories allows for a better picture of what end users will want to see that tend to go unnoticed from the developers eyes. Its liek creating a competitve game but all the devs are casual players and do not have an understanding of competitiveness, so thats when you incorporate playtesting or in this case user stories to get a better understanding.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- I believe in order to be a good team member, you should be able to hold your own in a way where you are not a liability to others, be able to communicate properly and convey your thoughts aswell as to maintain  positive attitude.
